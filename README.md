# Cat-Love-You

An very simple Expert System, to tell what type is your cat.


Rather than re-inventing the wheel, I'am going to use some readily available solution. There are several expert systems out there and I'll focus on those which are either in Python or can be used via Python.


### CLIPS

    ```CLIPS``` is an expert system developed by NASA, it's considered state of the art and used in university courses when teaching the basics of AI (idk why it's a sepreated Course though). 

    it's written in Lisp. The advantage of CLIPS is that is a solid C engine which can be fully integrated with any other Python system via its bindings: the older pyclips and the newer clipspy. The bindings allow to embed Python code within the CLIPS language making it very easy to extend.

    Rules can be loaded at runtime without the need of restarting the engine which should better suit your need.


### PyKnow/Experta 

    Here we can express knowledge bases mostly in Python
